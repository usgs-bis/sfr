# Spatial Feature Registry
The Spatial Feature Registry is one component of the Biogeographic Information System our group in USGS is building. This repo is where we are building the data processing logic for how we register source material, process datasets into a usable form, and synthesize the data for use. We will build out and document the SFR APIs through other projects.
